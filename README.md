# GA Chrome Tab

Hey, since we all use Chrome I thought I'd make a browser extension for the class. Every time you open a new tab you'll see the links we use for class.

## Installation

1. Git clone this repo locally
2. Go to the extensions pane in Chrome (chrome://extensions)
3. Enable the "Developer mode" checkbox
4. Click "Load unpacked extensions..."
5. Find the local copy of the repo and click "Select"
6. Make sure you uncheck other new tab extensions like Peter's weather thing.
7. Go to the settings pane in Chrome (chrome://settings)
8. Choose the "Open the New Tab page" setting for "On startup"

##Still in development...
I'd love to add more stuff to this or refine the links list.

I'd like to add:

<ul> 
<li> a javascript menu</li>
<li> better css</li>
<li> a way to set local settings</li>
</ul>
